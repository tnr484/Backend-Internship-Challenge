# Backend-Internship-Challenge

Tech Stack - Python, FastStack, and CoinGecko's public API

How to run/test locally - Added a link at the bottom of my code to test it

What to build for next time - Code has error with resetting information, meaning multiple attempts would end up with different information/incorrect information.
